***
## Project overview
This project will be looking at the number of LEGO sets released based on specific movie releases from certain years. It would find the number of *Marvel Superheroes* sets after movie releases of a certain year.

## Used datasets
Most of the datasets from this project comes from different datasets that people created in a data-science website called [**Kaggle.com**](https://www.kaggle.com).

## Motivation
**Why LEGO?**

One of the reasons why LEGO was chosen from all the other topics that could be used, was because I, myself, have great interest in LEGO. Using LEGO into this project would be an interesting project to do, and it would also be an exciting project for me. LEGO is also pretty popular among many young children, but is also used among people of all ages. Also, data for LEGO is not that very common, and there is not a lot of deep, deep data for LEGO's statistics, so this project would help those who need some data for LEGO.

**Then why Marvel?**

Marvel is one of the biggest movie franchises in the world. It had released at least 15 movies during 2002 ~ 2015, and is still currently creating more movies. The MCU is one of my favorite movie franchises right now, and it is also loved by many fans and people around the world. If talking about Avengers, Marvel has created from *Spider-Man*, all the way to movies such as *Avengers: Infinity War* or *Captain America: Civil War*, while improving their style, design, and quality of their movies.
